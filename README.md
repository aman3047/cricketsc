I would like to work on cricket scoresheet.It is propsed to devlop an application which can display wickets, names of batsmen and bowlers,overs,extras, economy of bowler,strike rate of batsmen,etc. and a WASP which is winning and score predictor which predicts score of batting team in first innnings and percentage of winning in  second innings, this feature is used by SONY sports network
when the  file of cricket score sheet is executed,my code will display a menu in which options will be creating new scoresheet , displaying  old scoresheet. It asks user to feed match info and runs ball by ball and it calculates strike rate , economy,etc automatically and displays it.It will take care of no balls, wide balls,byes,wickets,etc. It saves scoresheets of all matches and user can see these scoresheets later.
I would like know how to handle graphical interface, how to create our own header file and most importantly from where to start, how to work on the project!
