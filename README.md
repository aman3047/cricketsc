I would like to work on cricket scoresheet.It is propsed to devlop an application which can display wickets, names of batsmen and bowlers,overs,extras, economy of bowler,strike rate of batsmen,etc. and a score predictor which predicts score of batting team in first innnings and percentage of winning in  second innings.
when the  file of cricket score sheet is executed,my code will display a menu in which options will be creating new scoresheet , displaying  old scoresheet. It asks user to feed match info and runs ball by ball and it calculates strike rate , economy,etc automatically and displays it.It will take care of no balls, wide balls,byes,wickets,etc. It saves scoresheets of all matches and user can see these scoresheets later.
